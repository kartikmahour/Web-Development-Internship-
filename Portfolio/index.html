        <h3><u>Amazon.in Homepage HTML Clone</u></h3>
        <p><h4><strong>Description:</strong></h4>
          <ul>
          <li>As part of my HTML development skills, I undertook a project to clone the Amazon.in homepage. This project involved carefully examining the HTML structure of the live website and replicating it as accurately as possible.</li>
          <li>Use semantic HTML tags like header, div, and footer to offer meaning and context to the material. Correct use of and components to group and style material. HTML components should be nested and ordered correctly.
            Use ARIA responsibilities to increase accessibility.The text should be structured properly using headers, paragraphs, and lists. Meta, link, and script tags are used to give additional information and functionality.</li>
          <li>Throughout the project, I made sure that the HTML was clean, well-organized, and simple to maintain. I also tested the HTML in other browsers to guarantee compatibility and uniformity.</li>
          <li>Overall, this assignment allowed me to obtain a better understanding of the HTML structure of complicated websites while also improving my HTML programming skills.</li>

        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <h3><u>Gym Registration Form Webpage</u></h3>
        <p><h4><strong>Description:</strong></h4>
          <ul>
          <li>This is a simple webpage designed to allow users to register for a gym membership.
            The webpage features a clean and user-friendly layout with a registration form that asks users to provide their name, age, gender, locality, email address, and phone number.</li>
          <li>The HTML code for the webpage is well-structured and organized, using semantic HTML tags such as header, nav, form, and input to provide proper context to the content.
            The form includes a JavaScript function to validate the phone number input and ensure that it is 10 digits long.</li>
          <li>The webpage design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
            The CSS styling is separated from the HTML code in a separate file, which promotes clean and maintainable code.</li>
